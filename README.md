Tetra - Winter 2017
Experimental Rebuild of the tetra app using node to clean up code.
It will use a more modern stack, particularly with Webpack 2 to send just one
bundled JS file to clients, clean up code, and isolate functions to files.

Rebuild will be incremental, first to test PapaParse in node, then fix the
statistics math, then add in THREE.js
